    "The null hypothesis ($H_0$) is the theoretical conclusion to the experiment or study such that the outcome will not be favourable to what we want to show. For example, if we're measuring the mean of water levels in meters and we expect the mean the water level to be different from 5m, the null hypothesis is that the mean still remains to be 5 after the experiment finishes. \n",
